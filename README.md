# React Demos

These are a collection of demos used in Speeding Planet's React classes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Caveats

At the moment, the "Cancel Promises (axios)" demo relies on running a server on localhost:8000. Updating this to 
use a server that is part of this install is a high priority.
